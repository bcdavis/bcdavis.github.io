So, this iteration of the project will save the name of the audio file recorded, but not the file itself until I incorporate some external support from a file-storing resource like Cloudinary."],retrospective:["Completed my second capstone for Nashville Software School by creating a React web app.","In the future I plan to add a fully supported audio recording system by integrating support from Cloudinary and full-time database hosting with Firebase.","If I could do this project again, I would do more user testing with my Figma prototype and versions of the final product online."]}}],B={cta:"I'm excited to work together with you and your team!",btn:"",email:"bcollinsdavis@gmail.com"},H={networks:[{id:Object(D.a)(),name:"linkedin",url:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-c-davis/"},{id:Object(D.a)(),name:"github",url:"https://github.com/bcdavis"}]};var J=function(){var e=Object(s.useState)({}),t=Object(d.a)(e,2),a=t[0],i=t[1],n=Object(s.useState)({}),r=Object(d.a)(n,2),h=r[0],u=r[1],m=Object(s.useState)([]),p=Object(d.a)(m,2),b=p[0],g=p[1],w=Object(s.useState)({}),O=Object(d.a)(w,2),v=O[0],x=O[1],S=Object(s.useState)({}),k=Object(d.a)(S,2),N=k[0],C=k[1],I=Object(s.useState)({}),_=Object(d.a)(I,2),F=_[0],D=_[1];return Object(s.useEffect)((function(){i(Object(l.a)({},U)),u(Object(l.a)({},W)),g(Object(c.a)(A)),x(Object(l.a)({},B)),C(Object(l.a)({},H)),D(Object(l.a)({},L))}),[]),Object(o.jsx)(o.Fragment,{children:Object(o.jsx)("main",{className:"flex-row main-page-container",children:Object(o.jsxs)(j,{value:{hero:a,nav:F,about:h,projects:b,contact:v,footer:N},children:[Object(o.jsx)("button",{className:"mobile-menu-base-tab",type:"button",onClick:function(e){return function(e){e.currentTarget.classList.toggle("open");var t=document.getElementById("vert-nav");e.currentTarget.classList.contains("open")?t.classList.add("sidenav-open"):t.classList.remove("sidenav-open")}(e)},children:Object(o.jsx)("div",{className:"menu btn2","data-menu":"1",children:Object(o.jsx)("div",{className:"icon"})})}),Object(o.jsx)(R,{}),Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"right-content",children:[Object(o.jsx)(f,{}),Object(o.jsx)(y,{}),Object(o.jsx)(M,{}),Object(o.jsx)(E,{}),Object(o.jsx)(T,{})]})]})})})};a(53),a(54);r.a.render(Object(o.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(o.jsx)(J,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[55,1,2]]]);
